<h1 align="center">logic.sim</h1>

This is a small logic gate simulator for experimenting with how logic gates work. I only tested it on Ubuntu 22.04. For it to work you need to have a few sdl2-dependencies installed.

## Installation:

### Clone Repository:
```console
$ git clone git@github.com:ohnchen/logic.sim.git
$ cd logic.sim
```

### Install dependencies:
```console
$ sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttx-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev
$ sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2t_ttf sdl2_image sdl2_gfx
```
